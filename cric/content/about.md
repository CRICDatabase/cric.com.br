Center for Recognition and Inspection of Cells (CRIC)
is dedicated to research and development of  software tools and organized cell image catalogues through automated cell morphometry and recognition using machine learning. Recent work show advancements on cervical cell analysis of images from SUS (Brazilian Universal Health System), and human brain tissue and cells from Memory and Aging Center at UCSF. Together, we have built analytical and data-driven models using image collections and metadata provided by our collaborators.
